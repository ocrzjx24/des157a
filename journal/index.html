            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

                Reading through the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> was greatly insightful. I was aware of the impact of good user interface and experience in a form, but this article highlighted ways I had not considered in which UIUX could be applied. Making the form one column, sizing fields to match expectations, minimization of dropdown menus, etc. were all things that I had maybe vaguely recognized but never put much thought into.

                Many of the pain points brought up throughout the page are certainly things I've dealt with, as well. For example, forms that are too long / wordy definitely turn people away, and as the president of a club that regularly sends out forms, I've noticed this in comparing the number of people who start a form, who get halfway through, and who finish. I myself have certainly chosen not to complete a form purely because of its length.

                One online form I think exemplifies these best practices is the <a href="https://apply.calhacks.io/">CalHacks 12.0 Application Form</a>. My friends at Berkeley put this together, and it's cool to see something so visually appealing yet clean. Questions are all formatted and spaced nicely, and all information that is required of me is clearly stated.
