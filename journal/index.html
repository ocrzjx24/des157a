            <h2>4. Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
            <date><em>October 30, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                I exchanged images with Tony, who had really cool pictures he took of some birds at the Raptor Center. As a note, from his suggestion, I decided to change up the images I'm using for my project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tony's photograph depicts an owl standing on a wooden plank with a window behind it, in a dimly lit teal room. There are blurry diamonds up front, revealing that the bird is in a large caged area. To me, there's definitely something mysterious and perhaps even unsettling or grim about the photo, which I think is very interesting. The overall tone is cool and uncertain. The owl is framed in one of the diamonds of the fence and is offset from the center, making for an intriguing composition. It also appears to be mid-action -- perhaps walking or preparing to take off, which adds to a sense of tension. The colors are all dark but the bird pops out against the teal walls, while the chain fence in front is simultaneously hard to discern and clearly there. The wooden plank and window offer some interesting shapes for the overall composition, too, while being dark enough that they do not draw attention away from the other main elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most obvious part of the image is definitely the owl. It is immediately clear what we are lookign at. However, the greatest mystery comes from either the blurred out fence or the action of the owl. The uncertainty is really cool in my opinion, as we begin hypothesizing as to why the owl is posed the way it is, and the blurred fence may not immediately register, with it being out of focus perhaps serving some deeper meaning in the picture (if so desired).
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the best way to push a certain emotion or narrative with this piece will be through color grading. Pushing certain colors, making it brighter or darker, etc. can highlight different parts of the photo (the bird, the background, the fence) and draw attention in a way that can be deliberate. One could also consider darkening or blurring parts of the photo to bring attention to other parts. Last of all, and though I'm unsure if this is within scope, if the picture were retaken such that more of the fence we visible (still blurry), it could lean into a feeling of isolation and reveal an interesting visual pattern with the diamonds of the fence. Overall, this photo is already very thought-provoking.

            <p>
                Now, for my images, I'm still figuring out exactly which ones I want to use. I took most of these photos with friends in the past, as we're into photo editing and photography. I selected this one because I find that it has the most interesting composition and interplay with light and dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think this image is interesting because it looks like the eye of a dragon. On first glance, all it is is me standing in the sunlight in a forested area. But looking from a distance, it does somewhat look like the eye of a reptile, where I am the pupil and the sunlight forms the shape of the eye. This image is also special to me because it comes from a shoot that my friend and I had been ideating for ages, and we managed to finally pull off some really interesting shots, this being one of them. It was taken around noon at a local trail in San Ramon, but with some editing, I increased the contrast between light and dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                I originally wanted my topic to be sunshine, both literal and figurative, but now I am thinking of making it more akin to times of day or yin-and-yang; something that involves high contrast, especially between light and shadow. This image definitely has high contrast, but even in the realm of the sunshine idea, it plays directly with having a very isolated spot of sunlight. With me appearing lost yet unbothered, it also plays with the idea of sunshine figuratively -- this is perhaps a highlight of my life in which I find myself peacefully enjoying the good times.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want my archive to not only show off my aesthetics and passion as a photographer / editor, but to tap into a part of my life that I want to share with the world, being my friendships (that I hold near and dear to my heart) and my view on life. I always try to be optimistic, looking for sunshine and understanding good times don't shine without bad times (shadow). Furthermore, as an artist, I really am always observing the world as if framing compositions, and I want my photos to reflect that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think I might remove the noise filter from my photos and I'll try making the colored ones black-and-white, to figure out how contrast is active in them.

            <h2>3. Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <date><em>October 28, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                As we move into a project involving meaningful, conceptual photography, we took a look at <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs</a>, with the goal of not just taking photos for granted but understanding the multi-layered and intertwined deeper meanings about them. Indeed, the ten photographs in this article are not as simple as they seem, and may even appear confusing at first. There can even be multiple interpretations weaned from a single photo, which I find really interesting -- it really is a testament to how photography is a form of art.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of our research, we were told to find and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a website that utilizes image and interaction heavily. I found <a href="https://ova-investment.com/">OVA Investment</a>, which is a beautiful, clean interactive site. I found it to be incredibly visually striking and overall enjoyable to explore (and see all the different pictures), but I felt that there were a couple of major drawbacks. Namely, the site speed / optimization was relatively poor (did not run well with how it implemented these high-resolution photos) and it felt somewhat difficult to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm certainly inspired and curious as to how I can explore imagery and interaction in a website, making something innovative, unique, but not overwhelming or difficult to use.

            <h2>2. Best Practices for Overlays</h2>
            <date><em>October 16, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                This time, I took a look at <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog</a>. After learning how to make overlays in class, the once-daunting task of creating an overlay window is now not only within reach but quite inspiring for future projects. This article was a solid read, providing very useful advice towards how to utilize overlays effectively and not make them redundant or annoying to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think one thing that stood out to me as particularly insightful was the anatomy of an overlay window. The five main elements this article defined were the title, size, close / escape, button label, and shadow. To me, the shadow and typically small and centered nature of pop-ups and overlays were something I took for granted and didn't really consider until now; I realize how important they are to a smooth and inobtrusive user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article also ends with several important questions for designers to keep in mind. Overlays can be fun and aesthetically interesting, but at the end of the day, the goal is to gather info quickly -- this requires the overlay to be easy-to-read, comprehensive, and not frustrating to deal with. What information do we need from the user, and how will we convey that we need it in such a way they immediately know and are inclined to provide it? This question, among others, will definitely be something I reflect upon as I move forward with my designs.

            <h2>1. Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date><em>October 14, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                Reading through the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> was greatly insightful. I was aware of the impact of good user interface and experience in a form, but this article highlighted ways I had not considered in which UIUX could be applied. Making the form one column, sizing fields to match expectations, minimization of dropdown menus, etc. were all things that I had maybe vaguely recognized but never put much thought into.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the pain points brought up throughout the page are certainly things I've dealt with, as well. For example, forms that are too long / wordy definitely turn people away, and as the president of a club that regularly sends out forms, I've noticed this in comparing the number of people who start a form, who get halfway through, and who finish. I myself have certainly chosen not to complete a form purely because of its length.
            </p>
            <p>
                One online form I think exemplifies these best practices is the <a href="https://apply.calhacks.io/">CalHacks 12.0 Application Form</a>. My friends at Berkeley put this together, and it's cool to see something so visually appealing yet clean. Questions are all formatted and spaced nicely, and all information that is required of me is clearly stated.
