            <h2>3. Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <date><em>October 28, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                As we move into a project involving meaningful, conceptual photography, we took a look at <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs</a>, with the goal of not just taking photos for granted but understanding the multi-layered and intertwined deeper meanings about them. Indeed, the ten photographs in this article are not as simple as they seem, and may even appear confusing at first. There can even be multiple interpretations weaned from a single photo, which I find really interesting -- it really is a testament to how photography is a form of art.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of our research, we were told to find and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a website that utilizes image and interaction heavily. I found <a href="https://ova-investment.com/">OVA Investment</a>, which is a beautiful, clean interactive site. I found it to be incredibly visually striking and overall enjoyable to explore (and see all the different pictures), but I felt that there were a couple of major drawbacks. Namely, the site speed / optimization was relatively poor (did not run well with how it implemented these high-resolution photos) and it felt somewhat difficult to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm certainly inspired and curious as to how I can explore imagery and interaction in a website, making something innovative, unique, but not overwhelming or difficult to use.

            <h2>2. Best Practices for Overlays</h2>
            <date><em>October 16, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                This time, I took a look at <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog</a>. After learning how to make overlays in class, the once-daunting task of creating an overlay window is now not only within reach but quite inspiring for future projects. This article was a solid read, providing very useful advice towards how to utilize overlays effectively and not make them redundant or annoying to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think one thing that stood out to me as particularly insightful was the anatomy of an overlay window. The five main elements this article defined were the title, size, close / escape, button label, and shadow. To me, the shadow and typically small and centered nature of pop-ups and overlays were something I took for granted and didn't really consider until now; I realize how important they are to a smooth and inobtrusive user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article also ends with several important questions for designers to keep in mind. Overlays can be fun and aesthetically interesting, but at the end of the day, the goal is to gather info quickly -- this requires the overlay to be easy-to-read, comprehensive, and not frustrating to deal with. What information do we need from the user, and how will we convey that we need it in such a way they immediately know and are inclined to provide it? This question, among others, will definitely be something I reflect upon as I move forward with my designs.

            <h2>1. Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date><em>October 14, 2025</em></date>
            <p>
                Reading through the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> was greatly insightful. I was aware of the impact of good user interface and experience in a form, but this article highlighted ways I had not considered in which UIUX could be applied. Making the form one column, sizing fields to match expectations, minimization of dropdown menus, etc. were all things that I had maybe vaguely recognized but never put much thought into.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the pain points brought up throughout the page are certainly things I've dealt with, as well. For example, forms that are too long / wordy definitely turn people away, and as the president of a club that regularly sends out forms, I've noticed this in comparing the number of people who start a form, who get halfway through, and who finish. I myself have certainly chosen not to complete a form purely because of its length.
            </p>
            <p>
                One online form I think exemplifies these best practices is the <a href="https://apply.calhacks.io/">CalHacks 12.0 Application Form</a>. My friends at Berkeley put this together, and it's cool to see something so visually appealing yet clean. Questions are all formatted and spaced nicely, and all information that is required of me is clearly stated.
