        I made some edits to the pictures, increasing contrast and improving consistency, as well as making color versions of them as well. I haven't yet fully thought out how I want the pictures to interact with one another or how the user interacts with them, but that will definitely come soon. I plan on making something where the area over which the mouse hovers changes to reveal color, and I want to add some other idea that forces the images to overlap or play with one another. I am still ideating and want to find something that makes the pictures connect with each other.
